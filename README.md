## Overview

HR Valley Agent is a 24/7 chatbot designed to assist employees of Valley Water in navigating HR-related tasks such as benefits management, time-off requests, and career development. This chatbot is designed to streamline HR processes, improve employee engagement, and ensure quick access to essential HR information.

## HR Valley Agent: What is it?

**HR Valley Agent** is a virtual assistant built to provide comprehensive HR support to Valley Water employees. The system covers various HR services, including:

- **Benefits Exploration**: Understanding available benefits like health, dental, and retirement plans.
- **Time Off Management**: Checking PTO balance, requesting time off, and viewing holidays.
- **Performance Reviews**: Information on performance reviews, scheduling, and feedback processes.
- **Career Development**: Personalized career growth guidance and information about training opportunities.

Employees can use the chatbot to quickly access HR-related information and streamline various HR processes. The chatbot also assists employees with personalized support based on their position, department, and career development.

## Why HR Valley Agent?

Human resources departments are often overwhelmed with employee inquiries regarding benefits, time-off, and policies. HR departments also struggle with providing quick, accessible information during high-demand times, such as performance review periods or new benefits enrollment windows.

Existing solutions for HR services include:
- HR ticketing systems where employees can submit requests.
- Manual HR consultations for specific inquiries.

Our prototype aims to address these inefficiencies by:
- Offering 24/7 support for employees, reducing the need for real-time HR intervention.
- Assisting employees with all HR-related queries from benefits to performance reviews.
- Providing HR content tailored to the specific needs of Valley Water employees, without focusing on a single school or institution.

The primary objective is to improve accessibility to HR resources and reduce response times for HR-related queries, making the work environment more efficient and employee-friendly.

## Our Solution

We created a chatbot prototype designed to alleviate HR service load and provide employees with real-time HR support. The HR Valley Agent integrates with **OpenAI** and **Streamlit** for natural conversation and efficient user interaction.

Key features of the chatbot include:
- **Benefits Management**: Employees can easily inquire about and manage their benefits.
- **Time-Off Requests**: Simplifies the process of requesting, viewing, and managing vacation and sick leave.
- **Performance Review Information**: Provides guidance on upcoming reviews, goals, and feedback sessions.
- **Career Development**: Offers personalized career development resources, training opportunities, and HR-related professional growth tips.

The chatbot uses the employee's data (e.g., position, department) to provide personalized responses, ensuring that each employee receives tailored HR support. It integrates with Valley Waterâ€™s HR systems, offering a seamless and interactive experience.
